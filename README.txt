## Project Objectives
- Automate UI testing of Trello's web application using Selenium WebDriver and Python
- Implement API automation testing for Trello's REST API endpoints
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage for both UI and API functionalities
- Improve overall software quality and reduce manual testing effort
- Facilitate continuous integration and delivery processes

## Key Features
- **UI Automation**:
  - User authentication flows
  - Board creation and management
  - List and card operations
  - Drag-and-drop functionality testing
  - Profile and account settings management

- **API Automation**:
  - Authentication and authorization testing
  - CRUD operations for boards, lists, and cards
  - Webhook management
  - Rate limiting and error handling validation

- **Cross-browser Testing**: Automated tests run on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- **Parallel Execution**: Utilize multi-threading for faster test execution
- **Data-Driven Testing**: Implement parameterized tests for broader coverage
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generate comprehensive HTML reports with screenshots and API response logs

## Technologies and Tools
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+
- **UI Automation**: Selenium WebDriver
- **API Automation**: Requests library
- **Test Framework**: Pytest
- **Reporting**: Allure Framework
- **Version Control**: Git
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins (optional)

## Architecture
The project follows a Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for UI automation and a modular approach for API testing:

```

```

## Installation Guide
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ImadRabah/trello-automation.git
   cd trello-automation
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure environment variables:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Trello API key and token
   ```

## Usage Instructions
1. Run UI tests:
   ```sh
   pytest ui/tests
   ```

2. Run API tests:
   ```sh
   pytest api/tests
   ```

3. Run all tests and generate an Allure report:
   ```sh
   pytest --alluredir=./reports
   allure serve reports
   ```

## Test Coverage
- **UI Tests**: Login, Board Management, Card Operations, User Settings
- **API Tests**: Authentication, Boards, Lists, Cards, Members, Organizations

## Reporting
- Allure reports provide detailed test results, including:
  - Test case steps and status
  - Screenshots for UI test failures
  - API request and response logs
  - Test execution times and trends
